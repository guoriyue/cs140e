## Checkoff

There's not much to do for this lab:

1. Show a CA you have a working `blink` compiled using the toolchain from
   `setup/part2/blink-pin20.s` and started using the bootloader.
2. Bonus: write up a short example problem you ran into (or someone you helped
   ran into) and how you solved it. Post this to the newsgroup so we can start
   accumulating examples.
