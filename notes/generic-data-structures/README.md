## Using `cpp` to make generic data structures.

Simple-minded example uses of our generic data structure implementations.
These are all in libpi: 
  - `circular-T.h`: an interrupt-safe, lock-free circular queue implementation.
  - `list-T.h`: singly-linked list, head only.
  - `queue-T.h`: singe-linked list with head and tail.
  - `stack-T.h`: generic fixed sized stack implementation.

TODO:
  - Go through and regularize the uses.  Should have a common pattern.
