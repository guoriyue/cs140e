### Consider donating to the class!  

***(BUT: PLEASE DO NOT DONATE IF YOU ARE IN THE CLASS OR MAY APPLY TO STANFORD.)***

Donation methods:

  - [paypalme/hackerfood](https://paypal.com/paypalme/hackerfood)
    is our class paypal link to donate money for food
    and equipment.

    Even $30 helps defray costs, $250 will pay for a lab's worth of food,
    $2.5k will pay for a section leader (our default staff budget is
    seriously inadequate), and $12.5k can roughly cover the quarter.

    Note: this paypal method doesn't give a tax write-off.  On the other
    hand, there is zero administrative overhead, so the money goes right
    to the students.

    We're happy to send a photo of the receipt and food; or add a
    "sponsors" list if that is useful.  (I can also provide btc or
    eth links.)

  - For larger amounts where a tax write off is needed:
    email directly (engler@stanford.edu) to start the gift donation
    process through official Stanford channels.  

    One caveat: after some of the recent scandals you might have seen
    in the news, gift donations have become a several month affair.
    (E.g., Meta donated last year and it took about 3 months.)

  - We also take interesting equipment donations!   Anything with a 
    datasheet and 60+ quantities is potentially useful.

As always, all 140E class course materials are provided, free, in our github
repo, so helping this class helps others, too.

This quarter (2023) the class is 60 students, and meets from tue/th
5:30pm---midnight.  We provide all equipment and since the class is so
long and not easy, we provide food.

As with all past years, I largely pay for both food and equipment money
using my Stanford salary.  As the class size grows, this expense is on
track to be an noticeable portion of my take-home Salary.  E.g., even
with cheap domino's pizza with all coupons the food budget is going to
be around $500 a week.  (So about 5k a quarter.)
